          | Coding Soundtrack is fresh musical entertainment for those with Robot Ears. We are a community based around a Turntable.fm room where we play Non-Distracting music for coding sessions, and provide a creative community of Programmers, Developers, Administrators, Engineers, Hackers and a Troll. They come for the Music, they stay for the Lolz.
